Easily Go Live on YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, LinkedIn and many more social media platforms and multiple channels from within OBS.

Combines Functionality of multi-rtmp plugin and Restream like web dashboard for Easy Broadcast scheduling and management.

use streamway.in web dashboard to schedule live event across multiple social media platforms at once.
And in plugin select the scheduled Event (Broadcast) and start streaming.

That's it. It's that simple.

Since it's based on multi-rtmp plugin, it provides all the options multi-rtmp plugin provides and more. E.g.
Share encoders with main output of OBS to save CPU and GPU power. (Default Setting)
Use Server-Side Relay when not enough bandwidth or push directly from OBS.

Since it's a fork of Sorayuki's plugin. Special thanks and credit to him.
